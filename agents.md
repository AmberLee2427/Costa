Kiora Agents,

This repo is being developed by Greg Costa and Amber Malpas. We are working on a microlensing astrometry package. The code is working, but the package aspect still needs work. Ignore any unprofessional comments or commit messages; they are part of the charm. We would like this package to otherwise adhear to good coding practices but are not particularly knowledgeble on what those are. This is our first package, so we are stumbling in the dark a little. The package is for scientific use, so we will need to use a numpydoc style doc string. Only we haven't gotten around to it. :)

Amber and Greg
