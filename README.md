# Triple Lens Microlensing Tools

This repository contains tools and code for simulating single, double and triple-lens microlensing events, including image position solving, light curve generation, and centroid shift calculations. It uses a combination of numerical solvers, custom libraries, and scientific Python packages.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This code is functional but still under development ‚Äî improvements and cleanup are ongoing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

This project uses a regular Python packaging workflow. To install the
package and its minimal runtime dependencies, execute::

    pip install .

The local `TripleLensing` library will be built and installed
automatically as part of this process.

For development a more feature rich environment can be created using the
`environment.yml` file.
